What is Machin Learning?

Application:
    Self-driving Cars
    Robotics
    Language processing
    Vision processing
    Forecasting Stock Market Trends

Steps: 
    1. Import the Data(CSV)
    2. Clean the Data (Removing Duplicated Data is important otherwise 
        our model will learn bad pattern and produce wrong results)
    3. Split the Data into Training/Test Sets (Training- 80%, Testing-20%)
    4. Create a Model (Selecting an algorithms to analyze your data)
        Algorithms: 
            Decision Tree
            Neural N/w
            ....
    5. Train the Model
    6. Make Predictions (predictions are not always accurate so, step 7)
    7. Evaluate and Improve (Measure the accuracy) then get back to the model 
        and fine-tune the parameters/selecet different model/Algorithms

Libraries and Tools: 

Libraries:
    Numpy- Multi-Dimensional Array
    Pandas- Data Analysis library that provides DataFrame(2D structures/spreadsheet)
    Matplotlib- 2D plotting library for creating graphs and plots
    Scikit-learn- Machine Learning library for common algorithms

Tools: 
    Anaconda
    jupyter notebook
    visual studio code
