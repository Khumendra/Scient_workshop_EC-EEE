Problem:
Online music store when user singup ask for age and gender and based on their profile we recommand
various music albums they are likely to buy. In this project we will use Machine Learning to increase 
sales.

Build the model feed the model with sample data based on existing users, our model will learn the pattern
in our data so we can ask it to make predictions. Whenever a new user signs up we tell our model we have a 
new user with this profile what is a kind of music that this user is interested in, our model will jazz or hip-hop 
or whatever and based on that we can make suggestion to the user

Steps:
    1. Import the data
    2. Clean the data
    3. Split the data into training/test sets
    4. Create a Model
    5. Train the model
    6. Make predictions
    7. Evaluate and Improve (if not accurate we either fine tune our model or select a different algorithm)
